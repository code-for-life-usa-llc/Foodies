        <h1>Itachi Uchiha</h1>
        <p><Strong>Itachi lives his life out at first as apar of the anbu black ops.</Strong> He was a pawn and was used by the leaf village. He was very loyal to the leaf even if he had to become an outcast. He also achieved the Mangekyou which is a variation of the sharingan, the mangekyou specializes in genjutsus and such. It also allows the user to manifest their susanoo which is basically a <em>big</em> amount of chakra formed like a person.<strong>Itachi Uchiha also <em>killed</em> the entire uchiha clan sparing sasuke, who is his little brother.</strong></p>
        <p>Itachi soon became apart of the akatsuki after fleeing the leaf village. Where whom he met pain who gave him a ring and invited him into the akatsuki.<strong>BUUTTTT the only reason why he joind was because the leaf wanted Itachi to infiltrate the akatsuki and give intel on them. The akatsuki consists of a bunch of rogue ninjas.</strong> One reason why he like him was because he was still loyal to the leaf even though he was put through so much. Another reason is while he was helping the leaf he made sasuke stronger in the process. Enabling sasuke to be one of the most feared ninja in the leafItachi fought his little brother sasuke. It was a really cool battle one which i took the time to downlaod and add effects and transitions too.<em>Itach died of an illness during the battle and then sasuke thought he resolved his revenge.</em> But after Obito told sasuke why itachi did what he did it became clear to sasuke what he had just done. and then comes the grieving and such.<strong><em>Itachi also joined the anbu at a young age which is extremely rare like 1 in a million type of thing. He was on kakashis squad.</em></strong></p>
