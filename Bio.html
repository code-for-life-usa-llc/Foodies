        <h2>Favorite Eminem Lyrics</h2>
        <q>In the midst of all of this im in a mental hospital with a crystal ball</q>
        <br>
        <br>
        <q>Till I collapse im spilling these raps long as you feel 'em</q>
        <br>
        <br>
        <q>See I'm a poet to some, a regular modern day Shakespeare<br>
Jesus Christ the King of these Latter Day Saints here<br>
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me<br>
As a monger of hate and Satan a scatter-brained atheist</q>
